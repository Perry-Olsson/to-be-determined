## Project Status -- ON HOLD

This was originally an impromtu collaboration with a friend whose education was put on hold via the pandemic in the attempt to build a social/event planning application. I built the account creation and authentication and ended up with an application you could register and log into just to find a blank page. I wanted at least something to show for, so I spent a few days building my first todo app.

In the future I plan on scrapping the todo portion and creating a subscription management application in its place. As I've been known to continue paying for subscriptions I don't use any longer.

## Feature Overview

- React Native application (functioning builds for both android and ios)
- Account creation/authentication with server and client side validation.
- Persistant sessions
- Email account confirmation using SMTP
- Create and delete persistant todo items with bulleted notes
- Account deletion
- Loading display module that targets individual components
